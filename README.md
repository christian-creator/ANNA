Agc Needs New Automation.
Im tired of doing alot of manual work, at my student assistant job and i will therefor automate alot of the work that i need to do.

GOALS:
Monthly QC memo:
  - Write a program which copies the data from the LIMS pull, into excel sheets of different rooms.
  - The program should be able to create excel plots from the copied data.
Mold count:
  - Write a program which counts every single datapoint, and the amount of datapoints which contains mold.
  
What do i need:
  - A list of the rooms where the location is specified ie. 1.A10: LI/II
  - The current excel data from every room.
  - The excel sheet for mold counting.
